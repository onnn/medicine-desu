    "Features" are what show signs (the game is from the doctor's perspective
    therefore symptoms do not exist, except maybe as something that is generated
    after the fact, for presentation in the office) <br /><br />

    As for now, organ systems do not exist. Problems should be localized, and it
    will be up to the doctor to understand how things work as a system.<br /><br />

    I have an idea for the lowest part, called cellcells. The represent large
    groups of cells. A conceiveable (dozens) number of cell cells should make up
    each organ component. Cellcells should have properties that lead to their patholgoies.<br /><br />

    Structures are repeating structures throughout the body. Things that aren't structures may be
    "structures" in the broadest sense of the word, but we will be using them specifically
    for small repeating units larger than cellcells. <br /><br />

    Structureally, patient is represented by a Body. Bodies have Parts. These are mainly structures. Features represent groups of structures but
    they should be ultimately generated by what happens to the structures, rather than being composed of them directly. Thus they are independent and
    do not truly make up the simulation, they are basically signposts. Emphasis on signs, because their purpose is to generate signs based on what
    pathology the patient has.<br /><br />

    Speaking of pathology, the current plan is to either generate a pathology based on randomly assigning all properties and seeing what emerges,
    or pre-deciding the pathology and setting properties like that. Since it's a doctors' office or hospital, patients should have on average more than
    0 pathologies, although some should have 0, with symptoms that are coincidental. I.E. red skin might be because the patient saw a red light on
    their skin, and mistook it for irritation. Bad example but illustrates the point. This should represent a small number of patients. Say 2% could have no
    pathology, 2% could have two, 0.5% could have three.<br /><br />

    There is the possibility of a chronic condition which leads to a higher chance of multiple pathologies to be considered.<br /><br />

    Use adjacency graphs to connect body parts for spreading and blood flow? Blood flow, simulate volume and velocity

    Eventually: two symptoms. If you guess there's only one and  you dont' treat the second one, the patient won't improve'

    include differential diagnoses. for instance, if the only sign is erythema, have two options: have you been
    handling anything, do you have allergies etc

    goal: set up epidermis so that if a symptom appears on the epidermis, dermis or hypodermis, the *same object* is referenced in the overlying feature

    body surface area? https://www.calculator.net/body-surface-area-calculator.html

    could be used to estimate cell counts etc
