A pathology and patient interaction simulator.

Note: This software does not offer medical advice, nor can you assume anything in it is based on reality. Simulation use only. In practice, the mechanics are derived from medical textbooks and peer-reviewed bio-medical journal articles, but I am a software engineer, not a medical professional.
